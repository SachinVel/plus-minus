        <div class='faq-question'>Are pdf formats supported?</div>
        <div>
            No, currently BSA does not support .pdf format bank statements to be imported.
        </div>
        <div class='faq-question'>Can we convert a .pdf type bank statement into .xlsx format and import into BSA?</div>
        <div>
            Yes, that is allowed, although, it has come to our attention that, in most occasions,
            PDF statements converted into excel usually contain more than one sheet and images in the file which make it
            extreme difficult for us to process the data and give out a desired output.
            PDF is meant for only data transfer and not data analysis. So, the converted statements can be brought to
            the standard bank statement format by the user and uploaded for accurate result.<br>
            <b>Note:</b> If there are watermarks, images, seal & signatures in the converted file, kindly remove the
            same before importing the .xlsx file.
        </div>
        <div class='faq-question'>Can we upload a bank statement in which we have worked & applied formulae to certain
            cells?</div>
        <div>
            Yes, that is allowed, although it is recommended to upload the statements downloaded from the bank's
            internet
            banking website without making any modifications (or) performing any arithmetic functions to the
            aforementioned file.
        </div>
        <div class='faq-question'>Where can we find the optimal bank statement format?</div>
        <div>
            We have given a bank statement format here, which can be referred the user.
            (Note: This is to bring to your attention that the format given by us is not a referral to the statement
            given by any particular bank.
            This is just an illustrative format to help the user to get a better picture which in turn helps us to serve
            you better.)

            The input fields are to be selected in the following order (by whatever name called in the bank statement in

            What recourse do I have if I have selected a wrong cell in the input field?
        </div>
        <div>
            If the user has selected the wrong cell as the input field, the X button near the input field can used to
            clear the value fed into the input field and another cell can be selected in its place.

        <div class='faq-question'>
            What does it mean if the cell values display [object Object] in the preview page of the uploaded file?
        </div>
        <div>
            The error [object Object] appears when the format of the data in the cells are not suitable. Kindly verify
            the format of the excel sheet again using the pointers given in optimal bank statement format and upload the
            file again.
            If the error still persists, kindly contact our support team.
